    Alessandro Sebastianelli graduated with laude in Electronic Engineering for Automation and Telecommunications at the University of Sannio in October 2019. He is enrolled in the PhD programme with University of Sannio, and his research topics mainly focus on Remote Sensing and Satellite data analysis, Artificial Intelligence techniques for Earth Observation, data fusion and Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation. He has been a co-Relator of thesis in Electronic Engineering, a co-Supervisor of MIT students (January 2019, 2020 and 2021), a member of the examination committees for Telecommunication Networks and for Signal Theory and Processing, he was also teaching support for the PhD course "Optical and Radar Remote Sensing". He has co-authored some papers to international conferences and to important journals for the sector of Remote Sensing (https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=WoTTS-UAAAAJ). He is also a co-Editor of a book entitled "Artificial Intelligence Applied to Satellite-based Remote Sensing Data for Earth Observation” (https://shop.theiet.org/artificial-intelligence-applied-to-satellite-based-remote-sensing-data-for-earth-observation). He is also a reviewer of scientific articles in his field of expertise. He has been a visiting researcher at Phi-lab in European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) of the European Space Agency (ESA), in Frascati, and still collaborates with the Phi-lab. He has won an ESA OSIP proposal in August 2020 presented with his Ph.D. Supervisor, Prof. Silvia L. Ullo. He was the winner of the GRS 29-Italy 2020 award for the three best master's degree theses in geosciences and remote sensing, organised by the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS, http://www.grss-ieee.org) and by the IEEE Italy Section (http://sites.ieee.org/italy/), iChapter GRS29 Central-North Italy (GRS29-CNI@https://cispio.diet.uniroma1.it/marzano/ieee-grs/index.html) e GRS29 South Italy (GRS29-SI @ http://ieee.uniparthenope.it/chapter/default.html). He is an IEEE Member, affiliated with IEEE communication society and IEEE Aerospace and Electronic system society.
